SWFBridge allows to include FlashyWrappers from a SWF file, which is useful mainly for the thread cloning only this external SWF instead of the main SWF, saving memory as a result + preventing lots of compilation issues in older Adobe IDE's (Flash CS6 / FB 4.7).

SWFBridge.swf inside the "SWFBridge" file MUST be copied into the projects root.
